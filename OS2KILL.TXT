/* killos2.c

   A program to remove OS2 system files from the root directory. Don't
     run this under OS/2 or a DOS Window!  Run from the root directory
     in DOS non-protected mode (normal DOS).  Will delete OS/2 hidden
     and non-dos files like 'EA DATA. SF' that can hang around and
     use up space if you don't realize they are there after deleteing
     OS/2 from your system.

   compiled under Microsoft C 5.1   ( Bill Gates would be proud!)

   written to delete OS/2 version 2.00 GA.
